% This is "aamas2013 .tex" September 2012 
% This file should be compiled with "aamas2013 .cls" 
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'aamas2013 .cls'
% LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to AAMAS 2013  conference. This file is based on
% the sig-alternate.tex example file.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file of ACM will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
% than the original style ACM style.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls ) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with AAMAS data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'aamas2013 .cls' you don't have control
% from within the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the IFAAMAS Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% These information will be overwritten by fixed AAMAS 2013  information
% in the style files - it is NOT as you are used with ACM style files.

\title{Evolutionary Game Theory in Extensive-Form Games using Sequence Form Representations}

% AUTHORS


% For initial submission, do not give author names, but the
% tracking number, instead, as the review process is blind.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

%\numberofauthors{8} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the

\begin{abstract}
Evolutionary game theory has been used to model interactions in populations of rational agents. 
However, research in complex interactions, as modeled by general extensive-form games, has been researched 
significantly less so than its normal-form ``one-shot'' counterpart. 
Recently, replicator dynamics have been adapted to extensive-form games represented in sequence form, leading to 
a large reduction in computational resources. 
However, the properties of systems following these dynamics remain unknown.
In this paper, we provide the first evidence of convergence to equilibrium strategies. In additon, we generalize the
replictor dynamics to more than two players, and show that they can find equilibrium points in a 3-player game as well. 
Finally we analyze the stability of the solutions and derive new dynamics that can be used to approach equilibrium 
refinements, such as sequential equilibria.
